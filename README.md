## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I've been working on coding the mobile layout first, and this time was definitely easier than the last time. I've worked with the CSS grid layout before, but I feel like this challenge helped me understand it a lot better. Slowly but surely, I've started noticing that I'm planning ahead while I'm coding! 

### Continued development

I'd like to be more comfortable with CSS grid, so I'd like to find some projects that can help with that. I also plan to continue working on my organization, especially with CSS; I always end up having to work backwards and change whatever is keeping that div from sitting where I want it to, and end up making a mess of the code. With my next project, I think I'll start by hammering out a responsive layout, and then move on to styling.
